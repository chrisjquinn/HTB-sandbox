# HTB-sanbox
A collection of files and notes whilst working through the hack the box academy and such.


## Structure
Initially, I was just saving the cheatsheets from HTB academy, and was realising that I was forgetting what I was doing in the labs. Now, I create folders based on the modules, with my notes of what I learned vs. already know. The cheatsheets also get thrown in there, plus any tools and crafted items to get through the excercises. 

> **Warning** this may contain spoilers for flags. I may have half-handedly put the flags into here as part of note taking.


## Sub-modules
I have added the submodule of [SecLists]() as this was used extensively for some modules in HTB. To get this running:
```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
